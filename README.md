# WhackAMole

This is a simple one class version of the classic WhackAMole game.  Given a 10x10 grid and 10 randomly placed moles, the user gets 50 attempts to get all 10 moles.

## Usage

1. From IDE (such as **Eclipse**) simply open file and click **Run**

2. From command line, navigate to folder

- Run `javac WhackAMole.java`
- Run `java WhackAMole`

## Issues

Right now if you do not enter your coordinates in **x,y** format with x,y integers the program will throw an OutOfBounds Exception
